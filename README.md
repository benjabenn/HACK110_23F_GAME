# HACK110_23S_GAME

This is a PyGame game made for the Hack110 Advanced Topics in Game Workshop!

## Game Mechanics and Themes
- [X] Football players as sprites for player and enemies
- [X] Enemy players that follow the user-controlled player 
- [X] Collision detection that ends the game when an enemy touches the player
- [X] Collision detection to make enemies press up against each other ~~without overlap~~ and freak out a lil bit
- [X] Scrolling football field background 
- [X] Endzone that can be reached by player to win the game 
- [ ] ~~Blocking Teammates?~~

## Workshop Points of Discussion
- Gitignore the pycache folder
- Using a lot of built-in methods and classes (read documentation, tutorials, and google your questions!)
- Making a player that moves with arrow keys (dict with pressed keys)
- Making a moving background with a simple surface
- How to make enemies that follow the player
- How to make a win zone (just an invisible long sprite)
- How to make enemies that fly to the left and then ->
- How to add music (just a few commands!)
- Event queue
- Collisions
